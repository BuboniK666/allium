Allium is a library containing routines for scientific computations,
especially linear algebra routines and solvers for ordinary differential
equations.

**WARNING**: The library is still in *alpha* stage. Expect things to
break!

The full documentation can be found on the
[project website](https://hrittich.github.io/allium/)
